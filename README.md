# wp2-pipeline
NCRIS2013 Monitoring &amp; Reporting Work Package (WP2) - producer/consumer pipeline dev

Component categories:

* `producers` - Collect and submit raw data, for example system state, activity metrics, etc.
* `consumers` - Harvest submitted data for post-processing, summarisation, transformation, presentation, aggregation, etc.
* `maps` - Harvest, process and resubmit data, such as if an overly verbose source requires some form of reduction and it is desired to ingest this reduced/intermediate format.
